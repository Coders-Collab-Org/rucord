# Rucord - Rust Library for Discord API Interactions

**Note: This library is currently under development and is not yet recommended for production use.**

## Overview

Rucord is a Rust library designed to provide a high-performance and flexible interface for building Discord bots and applications. Built using Rust's async/await syntax, Rucord leverages non-blocking I/O operations to deliver a fast and efficient API for interacting with the Discord API.

Rucord provides a low-level API for granular control over the Discord API, as well as higher-level abstractions for common use cases. It is designed to be easy to use for developers of all levels, while still providing powerful features and scalability for advanced use cases.
